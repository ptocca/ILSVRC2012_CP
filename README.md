# Applying Inductive Conformal Predictors to ILSVRC2012 with ResNet50.

An educational demo of Conformal Prediction, a framework for prediction with validity guarantees under minimal assumptions.    
The demo uses `Keras Applications` model for ResNet50 [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) pre-trained on the [[ImageNet LSVRC2012 dataset]](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y).

CAUTION! Work in progress!

The demo can be run on BinderHub.
