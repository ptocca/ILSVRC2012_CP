# Applying Inductive Conformal Predictors to ILSVRC2012 with ResNet50.

An educational demo of Conformal Prediction, a framework for prediction with validity guarantees under minimal assumptions.    
The demo uses `Keras Applications` model for ResNet50 [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) pre-trained on the [[ImageNet LSVRC2012 dataset]](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y).

The demo can be run on BinderHub (click on the badge below).
NOTE: Recent changes to BinderHub seem to have broken AppMode (see [this](https://github.com/oschuett/appmode/issues/64) discussion). [AppMode](https://github.com/oschuett/appmode) is the package used to render a notebook as a web app. While the issue is sorted, please run the notebook (by clicking on the "fast-forward" icon in the notebook) and scroll down to the last cell.
